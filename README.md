Hi! Welcome to my github profile.

I'm passionate about promoting the benefits of open source development and helping connect Israeli developers with job opportunities in this thriving community. As part of this effort, I maintain a curated library of [Israeli open source projects list](https://github.com/lirantal/awesome-opensource-israel) that welcome donations and contributions. Check it out and join me in supporting this exciting ecosystem!
